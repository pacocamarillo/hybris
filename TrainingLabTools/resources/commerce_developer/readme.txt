Ken: This recipe provides a simplified version of b2c_acc_plus for 2211
It is now only slightly revised compared to 2205_intermediate level recipe and is not final yet.
It now also contains the Spartacus related extensions, so that if you have a separate Spartacus installation, the commerce can run with Spartacus together.

If any new extension is (not) needed, please revise it and let Ken know about it, thanks!
