			 Create the relation between an EBook and its author(s) here.
			 The fact that an EBook can have more than one author, and an author can
			 write more than one EBook, means we need to define a many-to-many relation.

			 	Tip: Remember that a many-to-many relation requires a lookup table
			 	to store the relation and so avoid a cartesian product

		<!-- Step 1
			 Here the main part of this lab:
			 You need to create a new type representing an EBook product. To do this, according
			 to the training material, you need to create a new itemtype that extends Product
			 (to inherit all attributes defined for Product).
			 You must also define the new EBook type as an object that is distinct from Product itself,
			 so be careful to set the autocreate and generate attributes to the correct true/false value.
			 For the full list of attributes that belong to EBook, refer to exercise documentation.

			<attributes>
				...
			</attributes>
		</itemtype> -->

		<!-- User, a standard Commerce Cloud type, is modified here to add to its definition
			 an attribute that refers to the status level created in step 3 (above).
			 You don't need to change anything here, just try to understand the logic.
